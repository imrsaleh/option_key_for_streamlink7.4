3. Navigate to:
   `C:\Program Files\Streamlink`
4. **Replace** the existing `pkgs` folder with the one you downloaded.

> **Note:** There's an error when running Dash due to an incompatibility with the built-in `ffmpeg` in Streamlink v7.4. To fix this, replace it with the compatible version (v5.1) provided in the releases.
